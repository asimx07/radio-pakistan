# radio-pakistan

This app streams Pakistani radio stations over the internet. The interface uses a calming vintage aesthetic.

## Customizing the Look

* **Fonts** – The default font is [Noto Nastaliq Urdu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Nastaliq+Urdu) loaded from Google Fonts. Update the `@import` line in `styles.css` to change the typeface.
* **Colors** – Global colors are defined in `styles.css`. Update the CSS variables under `:root` to tweak the palette.
* **Logo** – A vintage microphone logo is provided in `assets/images/vintage-radio.svg`. Swap it with your own graphic while keeping the `.logo` class in the HTML.

Include the `styles.css` file in your HTML pages to apply these styles.
